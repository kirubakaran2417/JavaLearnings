3.Problem Statement for the Given Program
  Objective: Write a Java program to create a BankAccount class that allows users to initialize account details using constructors, including an option for default balance initialization. Provide methods to display account details.

  Step-by-Step Approach:
  Define the Class:

  Create a class named BankAccount to represent the bank account details.
  Define Instance Variables:

  Declare private variables:
  String accountHolderName to store the name of the account holder.
  int accountNumber to store the account number.
  double balance to store the account balance.
  Create Constructors:

  Define two constructors:
  Full Constructor: Accepts all account details (accountHolderName, accountNumber, balance) and initializes them.
  Default Balance Constructor: Accepts accountHolderName and accountNumber, and initializes the balance to 0.0. Use this() to call the full constructor internally.
  Add a Display Method:

  Define a method displayDetails() to display:
  Account holder name
  Account number
  Account balance
  Create the Main Class:

  Define the Main class with the main method.
  Create a BankAccount Object:

  Instantiate a BankAccount object using the constructor that initializes the account with a default balance.
  Call the Display Method:

  Call the displayDetails() method to print the account information.
  Pseudocode:
  Create class BankAccount.
  Declare instance variables:
  String accountHolderName
  int accountNumber
  double balance
  Define constructors:
  Constructor 1: Accepts accountHolderName, accountNumber, balance.
  Constructor 2: Accepts accountHolderName and accountNumber, calls Constructor 1 with balance set to 0.0.
  Add a method displayDetails():
  Print accountHolderName, accountNumber, and balance.
  Create class Main.
  Inside main method:
  Create a BankAccount object using the second constructor (default balance).
  Call displayDetails() method on the object.
